“I see too many people in small businesses jumping to A/B testing as a way to validate an idea. A/B tests shouldn’t be used to find out whether an idea is a good direction to go in. They should be used to test the execution and optimization of an idea you’ve already validated as a good one.” 

- I forget which panelist said this; Daniella Patrick or Ellen Chisa ([The Value of Experimentation Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/preview/productthinking/events/236995537))
