## Thanks for the shout-out (Product Tank Meetup)

I appreciate the [acknowledgment](https://producttank.nyc/special-thanks/) (though admittedly my contributions was just putting up some content on Squarespace), but hey, sometimes that's all it takes to get the ball rolling. [Tremis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tremisskeete) is a great moderator and organizer. He puts a lot of energy into recording, writing summaries, archiving these talks. This is a Meetup group that consistently has solid line-ups, both in NYC and in chapters around the world. There's tons of video and articles generating by the global Product Tank group- so trying to understand what makes the most sense to include on the website for the local NYC community is an on-going process.
