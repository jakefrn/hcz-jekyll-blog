A side project I hope to get going in the coming months. This is the type of group I first searched for on Meetup a while back but didn't find. Then recently, after helping out a bit and talking with people at [ProductTank NYC](https://producttank.nyc/), I got the idea to just start my own group.

The easy part is done- creating a Meetup page and invited members. Rrom what I've been hearing from other people who have started their own groups- it takes a lot of time to keep a group going and growing.
