What I keep in mind are two universal rules- “Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should” and “Begin with the end in mind.” Before you have a designer polish that first draft wireframe into high-def mockup, or start building out shiny dashboards and complex reports in an analytics tool, or register accounts on every social media channel in existence, or hire content writers, really ask yourself (or coworker) what do you know (or assume) this endeavor will accomplish? And if it’s an assumption you’ve made, can you back it up with evidence?

Ambiguous goals and hopeful but unlikely outcomes are rarely sufficient justifications to divert your or your team’s time or resources. “Perhaps we’ll uncover new insights with this fancy new reporting tool, so let’s buy it.”, “Maybe redesigning the homepage again will increase engagement and user acquisition, so let’s do it.” “Lets hire content writers because that’s how you get ranked on Google.”

With that in mind, don’t NOT do anything because of analysis paralysis or lack of data. Making a product management decision is a balancing act of art (intuition) vs science (data). You can’t always produce data to backup assumptions, or expect your employee to be able to. You can’t always get user feedback and research. So it’s up to your own intimate knowledge of the problem you are solving (“scratching your own itch”) to serve as the data that guide your decisions.
