## First attempt at CSS Grid

I know there are a lot more properties available within display:grid but I wanted to make something quickly to learn the basics. I used a half-page ad layout I created for a tradeshow mag as a template to recreate. The **result** (ignore the sloppy media queries, responsiveness was an afterthought) is on  [Codepen](https://codepen.io/jakefr/pen/xXywEY). Also, the orange hearts are svg's set to blend-mode:multiple and I re-did the logo at the bottom in pure CSS for fun.
