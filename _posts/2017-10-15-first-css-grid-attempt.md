## First attempt at CSS Grid

I wanted to make something quickly to learn the basics of Grid so I used a half-page ad layout I created for a tradeshow mag as a template (below) to recreate. I know there are a lot more properties available within display:grid than what I used, which were just the basic essentials. The **result**  is on  [Codepen](https://codepen.io/jakefr/pen/xXywEY) (ignore the sloppy media queries, responsiveness was an afterthought). Also, the orange hearts are svg's set to blend-mode:multiple and I re-did the logo at the bottom in pure CSS just for fun.
