An excerpt from the book 'Creativity, Inc' by Ed Catmull (Co-founder of Pixar). 

He describes a scenario early in his career when a film he was involved in making didn't get finished in time. They showed it anyway, nervously, with unrendered scenes. To his surprise most of the audience didn't notice or care, because they were so absored in the story. 

This resonated with me because as much as I appreciate a pixel-perfect UI with subtle gradients and smooth as butter animations, at the end of the day- what really matters is the content (story). It's too easy to be in a thought-process like "Hm, my blog isn't getting traffic... so let me search for a sexier theme."
