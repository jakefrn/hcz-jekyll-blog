“I mandate customer interviews with my team. I am religious about talking to the customers. All Product Managers get on the phone 30 minutes a week to talk with one customer to know exactly how they used my product.. Have the customers keep the compliments of my product to their selves- what I want to find out are the pain points? And maybe also what is it that I can do that will get you to talk about my product to someone else? Getting an unsolicited recommendation is the ultimate goal of your business… Another thing I practice is don’t solution ideas in isolation. You are not the customer. You will go on the wrong path. Put it in front of your customers first. Whose feedback is more valuable- your own team’s, or the person who is handing over money to use this thing? Get out, get fresh air, have coffee and a candid unstructured conversation with your customers.”
