Digital Product Specialist with self-taught web development skills, design-thinking education, and product management knowledge. Installing, building, debugging, tracking, and assisting users with web-based products and services, and figuring out ways to make them better.

Hobbies include skimming through books, beating my high-score of 700+ hours of podcasts listened to on the Stitcher and Overcast apps, and combating the sedentary lifestyle with the gym, running, and stealthy stretches in the office bathroom. And tea.
