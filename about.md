Currently designing, building, and researching solutions in web, digital marketing, and customer experience for a top-rated local tour operator and portfolio of related brands to provide website visitors with nice digital experiences.

Hobbies include skimming through books, beating my high-score of 500+ hours of podcasts listened to on the Stitcher app, and combating the sedentary lifestyle with the gym, running, and stealthy stretches in the office bathroom. And tea.
